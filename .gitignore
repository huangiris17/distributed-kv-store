# If you use the "mix release" command, you might want to ignore generated releases:
/_release

# OS-specific
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Auto-generated documents
/doc

# Optional: If you don't want to commit your lockfile, you can ignore it,
# but typically you DO commit mix.lock so others can reproduce the same deps
# mix.lock
